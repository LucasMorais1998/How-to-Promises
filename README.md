## Introduction

Promises are a foundational feature of modern JavaScript designed to simplify handling asynchronous operations. They represent a placeholder for a value that will be available at some point in the future, either as a result of a successful operation (**fulfilled**) or a failure (**rejected**). Unlike callback-based approaches, Promises provide a structured and predictable way to manage asynchronous flows, avoiding common pitfalls like callback hell.

Promises have three states:
1. **Pending**: The initial state, where the operation has neither succeeded nor failed.
2. **Fulfilled**: The operation completed successfully, and the resulting value is available.
3. **Rejected**: The operation failed, and the reason for the failure is provided.

By chaining `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` methods, developers can build readable and maintainable asynchronous workflows. This makes Promises an essential tool for backend tasks such as managing API calls, database transactions, and other non-blocking operations in Node.js.
